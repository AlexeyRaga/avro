* Grep for XXX and fix - plenty of them.
* Remove dead code, commented out code and explorations.
* Recursive types - we aren't yet keeping a proper mapping of observed type names/schemas.
  - We don't account for identical schemas across name boundaries!
* Don't use 'Eq' when comparing schemas for compatibility - that includes docs etc.
* Unions should be non-empty lists.
* Deal with 'order'
* Collapse 'BasicType' and 'DeclaredType' into the single 'Type' data type.
* Refactor modules.
  - Schema also has lots of instances and parsing
  - 'Types' holds value types while shema hold type types - confusing!
* Make reasonable exceptions instead of using 'error'
* Lazily decode containers.
* Make 'encodeContainer'
* Dog food some more: Container decoding is manual, use the damned schema!

Consider:
* Encoding unions in JSON is the point we need the encoder schema... right? Crazy.
* Move to closer integration with Aeson
  * Move to using Aeson 'Value' instead of Avro.Types.Value?
  * Move to using Aeson 'Result'?  I want a MonadExcept instance.
* Use Attoparsec?
* Make a composible schema deconfliction `deconflict :: Schema -> Schema ->
  Schema` which requires embedding the decoding routine inside the schema so
  perhaps yuck.
* Prettier error messages, such as unresolvable schema's. (or, who cares,
  schemas can't be resolved deal with it?)
